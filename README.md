# Modified fonts for e-reading

The following fonts were slightly modified for my e-reading enjoyment. 

The fonts were all originally available under the OFL license.

I decided on the following fonts:

- [Charis SIL](https://software.sil.org/charis/) (has become **Charis eBook**)
- [Ibarra Real Nova](https://github.com/googlefonts/ibarrareal) (has become **Ibarra eBook**)
- [Gelasio](https://github.com/SorkinType/Gelasio) (has become **Gelasio eBook**)
- [Yrsa](https://github.com/rosettatype/yrsa) (has become **Yrsa eBook**)
- [Newsreader](https://github.com/productiontype/Newsreader) (has become **Newsreader eBook**)
- [Literata](https://github.com/googlefonts/literata) (has become **Literata eBook**)

The copyright disclaimers and such have not been modified, only some of the metrics and font family name information is different.
